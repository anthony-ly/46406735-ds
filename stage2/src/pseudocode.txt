Schedule jobs in round robin fashion based on the first server type returned by GETS Capable.

e.g. 
large job 0 goes to large server 0
large job 1 goes to large server 1
large job 2 goes to large server 2
small job 0 goes to small server 0
medium job 0 goes to medium server 0

When no more servers are available, schedule the job to the next suitable server based on:
1. how many running and waiting jobs the server has
2. the estimated run time of the job
